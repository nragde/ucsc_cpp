Example 1
Num Vertices = 5
Num Edges = 5
Work done = 6
Has Cycle = NO
DFS topological order = 5 4 2 3 1 
dfs assert passed

Example 2
Num Vertices = 5
Num Edges = 6
Work done = 7
Has Cycle = YES
DFS topological order = 2 4 3 1 0 
This order has no meaning

Example 3
Num Vertices = 5

Work done = 11
Has Cycle = YES
DFS topological order = 4 3 2 0 1 
This order has no meaning

Example 4
Num Vertices = 4

Has Cycle = YES
DFS topological order = 2 4 3 1 
This order has no meaning

Example 5
